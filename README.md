# Detection-of-dental-disease-using-deep-learning
This repository presents a deep learning–based system for automated detection and classification of dental diseases from oral images. The proposed model uses a fine-tuned ResNet-18 convolutional neural network with transfer learning to classify dental conditions into five categories.

Disease Classes

Mouth Ulcer

Dental Cavity

Hypodontia

Calculus

Tooth Discoloration

Methodology

A pretrained ResNet-18 model is utilized, and its final layers are fine-tuned to adapt the network for dental disease classification. This approach enables efficient learning from limited medical image data while maintaining high performance.

Performance

The proposed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 93% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying multiple dental disease conditions.

Key Features
